# Heap sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
* Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
