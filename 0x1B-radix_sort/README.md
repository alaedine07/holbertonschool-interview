# Radix Sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm

* Prototype: void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);
* You must implement the LSD radix sort algorithm
* You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
* You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
* Youâ€™re expected to print the array each time you increase your significant digit (See example below)
