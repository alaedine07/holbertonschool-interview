# 0x10. Rain
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

* Prototype: def rain(walls)

* walls is a list of non-negative integers.

* Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.

* Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.

* If the list is empty return 0.
